1. Did you start your function definition with def?
2. Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
3. Did you put an open parathesis ( right after the function name?
4. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?
5. Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
6. Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon after the arguments?
7. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function 4 spaces? No more, no less?
8. Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent ("dedenting", we call it)?

And when you run a function, check these things:

1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
2. Did you put ( character after the name to run it?
3. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
4. Did you end the function call with a ) character?
